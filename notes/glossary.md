# Preface
Terms in this glossary are only relevant to this project - for example, a
term like 'OpenGL' would not be in here (despite potentially being an
unknown term, this glossary would quickly become cluttered if it tried to
explain tech jargon).

As such, any confusing terms not detailed in this glossary can probably
be googled. If not, this is an issue.

# Glossary

3pcdf - Third party component definition format. This is an abbreviation
        for a yet-to-be-defined format to specify component state, properties,
        and layout. This will end up being something like XML or YAML.
