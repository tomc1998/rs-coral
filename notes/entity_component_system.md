# Using an Entity Component System to represent widgets

Entity component systems allow for great composability and great performance,
at the expense of it being a little awkward to wrap your head around. Luckily
this awkwardness can be abstracted by the engine, and the user only needs to
write 'business logic' implementations which will be hard-wired into the ECS at
compile time. See [Code Generation](code_generation.md) for more details.
